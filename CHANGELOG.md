Changelog
=========
1.1.11 - 2025-11-02
-------------------

- Optimised Postgres adapter now bypasses the connection pool for Prisma `$transaction` calls by default (`PRISMA_BUN_ADAPTER_DISABLE_POOL_FOR_TX=true`) to avoid the pooled “transaction already closed” bug.
- Added explicit environment flag handling for disabling pooling entirely (`PRISMA_BUN_ADAPTER_DISABLE_POOL`) and documented all switches in the README.
- Improved error propagation for transactional queries so Prisma receives the original `P20xx` codes instead of generic adapter errors.

1.1.10 - 2025-11-01
-------------------

- Improved column type inference: Enhanced detection of mixed types (arrays with non-array values, mixed primitive types). Columns with mixed types are now correctly classified as JSON, preventing type coercion errors.
- Enhanced JSON string handling: Added validation of JSON strings using JSON.parse before returning. Improved handling of malformed JSON strings (e.g., double-quoted strings like `""value""`) by unwrapping improperly wrapped quotes.
- Error handling: Added comprehensive error handling in optimized adapter's queryRaw method with proper error propagation.

1.1.9 - 2025-10-31
-------------------
Forgot to build to dist

1.1.8 - 2025-10-31
-------------------

Enhance Postgres adapter with improved argument coercion and connection management. Added support for JSON and array placeholders in SQL queries, ensuring proper handling of parameters. Updated connection pooling logic to pre-warm connections and avoid exhaustion. Introduced schema parameter mapping for search_path in connection strings. Added new test cases for comprehensive coverage. Added 'tests:setup' and 'tests:run' scripts to easily setup and run ALL tests.
Removed template cache from optimized PG adapter.

1.1.7 - 2025-10-28
-------------------
Added run-all-tests.ts,  sql.js dependency for SQLite fallback, update package version, and enhance test scripts for improved database setup and execution. Update performance comparison documentation to reflect changes in SQLite adapter testing methodology.

1.1.6 - 2025-10-27
-------------------
Several updates to tests.
Added run-all-tests.ts that... you guessed it, runs all tests.
Add sql.js dependency for SQLite fallback, update package version, and enhance test scripts for improved database setup and execution. 


1.1.6 - 2025-10-27

1.1.5 - 2025-10-27
-------------------

- Postgres arrays: correctly classify result columns that contain arrays as JSON so the Prisma engine parses them back into arrays. Fixes errors like:
  `Conversion failed: expected a either an i64 or a f64 in column 'labels', found ["ALL","READ","WRITE"]` when selecting array-typed columns.
- Preserve write-path behavior from 1.1.4: primitive JS arrays (string/number/boolean/null) are still coerced to valid Postgres array literals on bind across both adapters (standard and optimized).
- Fallback arg handling: if queries/transactions provide args but no recognized placeholders (e.g., certain Prisma-generated SQL), still pass the args and apply Postgres array coercion to maintain compatibility.
- Tests: add comprehensive array round‑trip coverage (text[], int[], boolean[]) and `ANY()` comparisons.

1.1.4 - 2025-10-26
-------------------

Fix: Postgres array parameters for primitive JS arrays are now coerced into valid Postgres array literals when bound through Bun’s SQL template. This resolves “malformed array literal: "ALL"” errors for columns like `text[]` (e.g., `permissions: ["ALL"]`). The coercion applies only to arrays of strings, numbers, booleans, or null; complex/object arrays are left untouched to avoid impacting JSON payloads.

1.1.3 - 2025-10-25
-------------------

Update README and source files to reflect package name change to @abcx3/prisma-bun-adapter, add optimized import patterns, and enhance TypeScript module resolution guidance. Introduce re-exports for optimized Postgres adapter and improve transaction handling in the optimized driver implementation.

1.1.2 - 2025-10-23
-------------------

- Prisma comprehensive test suite now self-seeds baseline fixture data and adds a date-field `prisma.user.update` benchmark to cover reported regression scenarios.
- Bun Postgres adapter transactions reserve dedicated connections and issue explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`, ensuring interactive transactions roll back correctly and clean up resources.
- Expanded regression coverage around transaction rollbacks and date updates to guard against future regressions.

1.1.1 - 2025-10-23
-------------------

- Documentation: explain the optional `@abcx3/prisma-bun-adapter/optimized` entry point, when to use it, and show sample code.

1.1.0 - 2025-10-23
-------------------

- Postgres connection strings: heuristic guard now detects unencoded reserved characters in credentials and falls back to a manual rewrite path, so unusual `userinfo` values no longer break adapter bootstrapping.
- Node compatibility: added explicit CommonJS `require` entries for the primary and optimized exports so consumers can `require("@abcx3/prisma-bun-adapter")` without bundler tricks.
- Tooling & scripts: new complex Prisma and raw SQL benchmark runners (`bun run test:bench:prisma-complex`, `bun run test:bench:sql-complex`) plus an `debug:example` watch script; documentation expanded with usage guidance and benchmark sections.
- Examples & tests: example apps now pull connection strings from env (with Docker Compose helper) and share the test database registry across integration tests, keeping the sample workflows aligned with the new scripts.

1.0.3 - 2025-10-22
-------------------

- Postgres placeholders: robust handling for complex/nested queries
  - Replace `$n` in descending order (e.g., `$12` before `$1`) to avoid prefix collisions.
  - Build per-occurrence argument mapping (`argOrder`) and expand args accordingly so repeated `$n` uses are respected.
  - Rebuild cached templates when argument count changes.
  - Ignore `?` as a placeholder on Postgres to avoid conflicts with JSONB operators (`?`, `?|`).
- JSON result handling: detect JSON columns by scanning rows and always emit valid JSON strings (fixes parsing errors like `Unexpected identifier "light_gray"`).
- Credentials: prevent double-encoding in connection string normalization (works with special characters in passwords without manual encoding).
- Cleanup: removed debug logging of connection strings.

1.0.2 - 2025-10-22
-------------------

- Postgres: Added multi-strategy connection handling to maximize compatibility with all passwords.
  - Tries normalized encoded URL.
  - Falls back to the raw `DATABASE_URL`.
  - Falls back to a variant that moves the password to a query parameter (`?password=...`) to avoid userinfo parsing issues in some runtimes.
- MySQL/SQLite: Retain normalization improvements from 1.0.1.
- Improved: Clearer errors for malformed URLs.
- Docs: Clarified that manual encoding should not be required.

1.0.1 - 2025-10-22
-------------------

- Automatic credential normalization/encoding for `DATABASE_URL` across Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite adapters.
- Robust fallback rewriter for “almost-URLs” to safely encode `userinfo` when the WHATWG URL parser rejects the string.
- Clearer error message when a malformed URL causes a URI parsing error.
- README updated about encoding & troubleshooting.

1.0.0 - 2025-10-21
-------------------

- Initial release with Bun-native Prisma driver adapters for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
